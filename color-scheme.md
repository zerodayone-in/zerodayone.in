# Zerodayone Color Scheme

## Overview

Zerodayone is a creative branding and solutions company that aims to create memorable, fun, and engaging brands. To achieve this, we've created a color scheme that's warm, playful, and approachable, while still being eye-catching and memorable.

## Color Scheme

Here's a breakdown of our color scheme and the reasons for each color choice:

- **Coral (#ff6b6b) as the primary color**: Coral is a warm and energetic color that's associated with playfulness, creativity, and friendliness. It's a color that can grab attention without being too aggressive or overwhelming, which makes it a good fit for a company that wants to convey a sense of humor and approachability.

- **Gold (#ffc107) as the secondary color**: Gold is a color that's often associated with luxury and high value, but it can also be used to convey warmth and friendliness. In this color scheme, we chose a brighter, more playful shade of gold that works well with the coral primary color. Together, these colors create a sense of energy and fun.

- **Mint Green (#5cdb95) as the accent color**: Mint green is a fresh and calming color that can evoke feelings of relaxation and creativity. It's a great accent color to use alongside the coral and gold, as it provides a nice contrast and helps to balance out the warm tones.

- **Pale Green (#f1faee) as the background color**: This light shade of green creates a calming, soothing effect that complements the other colors in the palette nicely. It provides a nice backdrop for our brand messaging and helps to balance out the brighter, more vibrant colors.

## Usage

Here are some guidelines for how we use our color scheme:

- The coral primary color should be used for headlines, calls to action, and other elements that need to grab attention.

- The gold secondary color should be used sparingly, to provide accents and highlights that complement the coral primary color.

- The mint green accent color can be used for backgrounds, icons, and other design elements that need to stand out without overwhelming the primary colors.

- The pale green background color should be used for backgrounds, to provide a calming, soothing effect that complements the other colors in the palette.

## Conclusion

Our color scheme is designed to be playful, approachable, and memorable, while still being eye-catching and professional. We believe that this color scheme will help us create engaging and memorable brands for our clients, while also reflecting our own brand personality.
